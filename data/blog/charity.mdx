I'll keep this blog short. I've always wondered which countries get most of the charity money, and which countries need more.

I couldn't find a good answer on the internet, so here's my attempt at the answer.


<div style={{ position: 'relative', width: '100%', paddingTop: '56.25%' /* 16:9 aspect ratio */ }}>
  <iframe
    src="/static/maps/world-map.html"
    title="Interactive World Map"
    style={{
      position: 'absolute',
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: '100%',
      height: '100%',
      border: 'none',
    }}
    loading="lazy"
  />
</div>
